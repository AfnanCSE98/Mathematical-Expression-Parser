# Mathematical-Expression-Parser
Suppose you want to evaluate a complex mathematical expression.for example, `cos(ln(x))*sin(2*x)+3*x*sqrt(.5/(x+1))`.You can't use string manipulation to evaluate this kind of expression.That's where parser comes into action.
This is a simple parser written in c++ to evaluate mathematical expression.
